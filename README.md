# Image Compressor & Resizer
> A modern tool to resize, compress, convert, and process images efficiently.

[![Python Version](https://img.shields.io/badge/python-3.10%2B-blue.svg)](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
[![Pillow Downloads](https://img.shields.io/pypi/dm/Pillow.svg)](https://pypi.org/project/Pillow/)

This project was created to solve a real problem at work: handling large sets of images that needed to be resized, compressed, converted, and processed for web and mobile applications without losing quality. The tool allows you to **batch process multiple images**, automatically resizing them to a maximum resolution, compressing them to a target file size, and converting between formats (WebP, PNG, JPEG). It is designed to save time, optimize storage, and ensure consistency when managing image assets.
